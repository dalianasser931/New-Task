                   1. The System will calculate the taxes (14% on all products) before applying any discounts or offers 
                   2. Then the system will check if you have ordered 2 items or more of t-shirts to apply the t-shirts/jackets offer, In Case of 'yes' it will calculates the 'number' of jackets on which the offer will be applied, e.g if you ordered 4 t-shirts so you will be able to enjoy the t-shirts/jacket offer on 2 jackets , and in case of ordereing 3 t-shirts you will get the offer on only one jacket etc.. Then the system will review the quantity of ordered jackets and if it exceeds the precalculated number of jackets enjoying discount , the exceeded amount will be added to your bill on Their original price
